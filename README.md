# Expo Go Runtime Error with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using native modules within Expo Go.  The app attempts to use a native module that is not fully compatible with the Expo Go runtime environment. This results in a runtime error during the app's execution.

## Bug Description

The primary problem lies in the incompatibility of certain native modules with the limitations of Expo Go.  Expo Go provides a convenient development workflow, but it has constraints compared to a fully native build. The specific error messages can vary, but they generally indicate problems with the native module's linkage or setup within the Expo Go context.

## Solution

The solution usually involves one of the following:

1. **Using an Expo-compatible alternative:**  Search for an alternative module that is specifically designed to work within the Expo ecosystem.  Many common native modules have Expo-compatible equivalents.
2. **Ejecting from Expo:** If an Expo-compatible alternative doesn't exist, you might need to eject from the Expo managed workflow to build a fully native app. This allows you to directly handle the native module integration without the limitations of Expo Go.  However, this increases the complexity of the development process.
3. **Using EAS Build:** For building native apps that require native modules, Expo's EAS Build service provides a streamlined process for building and distributing native apps.   This is a viable alternative to ejecting.

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Double-check the native module's documentation to ensure it's compatible with Expo Go or that you have followed all the necessary setup steps correctly.
* Verify that all required native dependencies are installed correctly in both your Expo project and in the native module itself.
* Consult the Expo forums and community for assistance in troubleshooting specific native module issues.
