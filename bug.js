This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a native module. The error message may vary, but it generally indicates that the native module is not properly linked or configured within the Expo Go environment.  This is often seen when attempting to use modules that require platform-specific code (e.g., Android or iOS).  The Expo Go client has limitations and may not support all native modules.
